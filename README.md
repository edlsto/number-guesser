Number-Guesser

FE1 Paired-Programming Project

Purpose:

This project gave us an opportunity to further develop our conceptual and functional understanding of JavaScript, practice and refine our knowledge of CSS and HTML, begin pair-programming, and establish good habits concerning the Git and Github workflow. To accomplish these things, we were tasked with recreating the "Number-Guesser" comp.

  > We used `for` loops, `if else` statements,

  > We took this as an opportunity to practice communication and empathy.

In the end, we have a fully functioning "Number-Guesser" game, below you can see our project.
